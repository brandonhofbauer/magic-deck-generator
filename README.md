# Full Stack React App to generate a random MtG deck, using the Scryfall API.
Calls to the API currently use a 'random' instead of 'search' string, which lead to a much slower generation time, as each card is being called individually. This is a feature that will be changed in a future update, in order to make random deck generation fast and smooth for users anxious to get their next game in.
